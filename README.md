This notebook is an adaptation of the [original by *Aurélien Gerón*](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb), from his book: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition. Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/)
The task consists of creating a *Machine Learning* model capable of predicting the median house price by district in California.

To do this, we will use a *dataset* of data from each census block in California from the 1990 census, with some modifications for educational purposes. Additionally, the dataset is not current, which is a bias that makes this dataset not very useful for the purpose we seek, but it is a good example for learning to work with real data if we set aside that fact (although it is very important to identify it).

This [dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices), along with details of its content and you can also find multiple notebooks like this one with different analyses and processing of the data.
