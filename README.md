This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using the California Housing Prices dataset. The goal is to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and population.

It's a classic dataset for regression tasks and is widely used for educational purposes in machine learning. The project is structured to guide you through the entire process, from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation; and it is a paraigmatic example of a **supervised learning regression** problem.
