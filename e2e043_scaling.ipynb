If one of the features has much larger values than the others, the distance will be dominated by this feature. For example, in our dataset, the range of 'median_income' goes from 0 to 15, while the range of 'total_rooms' goes from 6 to 39,320.\n",

In both cases, they are linear transformations that don't change the shape of the data distribution. In statistics there's usually a clear distinction between both terms, but in deep learning and computer vision, the terminology can be less consistent and **it's common to use \"normalization\" to refer to standardization**."

In general, Min-Max normalization should only be used if we're sure that the *outliers* are not errors.

    "**Heavy-tailed distributions** (also called right-skewed or positively skewed distributions) have a long tail extending towards large values.

    "\n",

This is because many variables (like prices, counts, or physical measurements) have a natural lower bound of zero but no upper bound, allowing extreme values only in the positive direction. Left-skewed distributions (e.g., age at death, test scores) are less frequent in this context and are usually handled differently (e.g., squaring or exponential transformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why heavy tails are problematic for ML models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradient-based optimization issues**: Models trained with gradient descent (linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks) compute gradients based on the magnitude of feature values. Extreme values produce disproportionately large gradients, causing unstable updates and slow or erratic convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance-based distortion**: Algorithms that rely on distance metrics (KNN, K-Means, SVM with RBF kernel) are severely affected. A single feature with extreme values can dominate the distance calculation, making other features effectively irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coefficient instability**: In linear models, features with large ranges lead to very small coefficients that are numerically unstable and harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outlier sensitivity**: Heavy tails inherently contain values that behave like outliers, pulling decision boundaries or regression lines away from the bulk of the data.\n",
