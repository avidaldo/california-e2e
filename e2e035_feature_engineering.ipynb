While [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](e2e030_eda.ipynb) focuses on *understanding* the data, feature engineering focuses on *transforming* it to improve model performance.\n",

    "It will often make sense to try to combine certain variables to obtain new, more useful variables. For example, the total number of rooms is not very useful if we don't know how many households there are. What we really want is the number of rooms per household. Similarly, the total number of bedrooms alone is not very useful: we probably want to compare it with the number of rooms. And population per household also seems like an interesting attribute combination to look at. Let's create these new variables.\n",
